ultramarine
===========

This is a 6.470 project done by Brodrick Childs and Sashko Stubailo during January 2013.  We won an honorable mention for our work.

The demo site is live at [ultramarine.herokuapp.com](http://ultramarine.herokuapp.com).

6\.470 is a web design and development competition during MIT's IAP (January independent activities period) every year.  This was our second year doing the competition - the first year in 2012 we created an online learning platform called [LearnTo](https://github.com/stubailo/LearnTo).
